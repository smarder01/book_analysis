# Plot Twists & Polarities: A Book Review Sentiment Model

## Objective
The objective of this project is to classify book reviews as positive or negative using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing the sentiment behind the reviews, this project will help readers identify how others feel about a book before making their own decisions.

## Project Overview
This project uses the **Goodreads Reviews** dataset from Kaggle to build a sentiment analysis model. The model will be trained to classify book reviews as either positive or negative based on the text content. We will leverage multiple NLP techniques, such as text preprocessing, vectorization, and machine learning algorithms, to train a classifier.

Key goals for the project:
- Preprocess the text data (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
- Implement various machine learning algorithms to classify sentiment.
- Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
- Explore advanced techniques using pre-trained models (e.g., BERT) to boost accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is the **Goodreads Reviews** dataset available on Kaggle. It contains thousands of book reviews, each labeled as either positive or negative based on the reviewer's sentiment.

The dataset includes the following:
- **Review Text**: The review content written by users.
- **Sentiment Label**: The sentiment classification, either positive or negative.
- **Book Information**: The title, author, and other metadata about the book.

You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Tech Stack
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing and text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building traditional machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) and evaluating model performance.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** (optional): For deep learning models, including transformers such as BERT, to improve the accuracy of sentiment classification.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing the dataset and model evaluation metrics.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (optional for exploration, though the code will be in `.py` files).
