# Literary Forecast: Rating a Book Before the Reviews Pour In

## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict a bookâ€™s rating before it gets any reviews, based on its title, author, genre, and description. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project aims to forecast how well a book might perform based on its intrinsic features, without waiting for public reviews. This is especially useful for publishers, marketers, and readers looking to gauge a book's potential success early.

## Project Overview
In this project, we focus on building a model that can predict the rating of a book using a set of textual features such as the book's title, author, genre, and description. These elements will be transformed into numerical features that a machine learning model can use to generate predictions.

The process starts with cleaning and preprocessing the data, followed by extracting relevant features from the textual data using various NLP techniques like TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT. Afterward, we use regression models to make predictions on the book's ratings. As a bonus, we explore the use of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, specifically designed for sequential data like book descriptions, to further enhance the accuracy of our predictions.

## Dataset
This project uses the **Goodreads Books dataset** from Kaggle, which contains information about various books, including:

- **Title**: The title of the book.
- **Author**: The author of the book.
- **Genre**: The genre or category of the book.
- **Description**: A brief description or summary of the book.
- **Rating**: The rating of the book (typically out of 5 stars), which we are attempting to predict.

The dataset offers a rich set of features that allows for meaningful exploration and feature engineering, including textual information that can be leveraged for advanced NLP tasks.

## Tech Stack
This project employs the following technologies:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis. It provides powerful data structures like DataFrames for handling and analyzing data efficiently.
  
- **Scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning that will be used for feature extraction, model building, and evaluation. Scikit-learn provides several tools for transforming data, applying regression models, and assessing model performance.

- **NLP Techniques**: 
  - **TF-IDF**: A popular technique used to evaluate how important a word is in a document relative to a collection of documents. This technique will be used to convert text features (like book descriptions) into numerical data.
  - **Word2Vec**: A neural network model that learns vector representations of words, capturing semantic meaning and context. Word2Vec will be used to transform words into dense, meaningful embeddings.
  - **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A more advanced NLP model that understands context in text better by considering both the left and right context of words. This model will be used for deeper text representation and feature extraction.

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suited for processing sequential data. LSTM will be used to capture the sequential nature of book descriptions and make more accurate predictions based on text patterns.
