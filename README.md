# Bookish Bytes: Sentiment & Recommendation Magic ðŸ“–âœ¨ðŸ”®
Book Recommendation and Sentiment Analysis Projects

Welcome to the **Book Recommendation and Sentiment Analysis** repository! This collection of projects focuses on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze book reviews, recommend books, and predict book ratings. The repository contains three primary projects:

1. **Book Review Sentiment Analysis (NLP)**: Classify book reviews as positive or negative.
2. **Personalized Book Recommendation System**: Recommend books based on a user's past reading history.
3. **Predict a Book's Rating Before It Gets Reviews**: Predict a book's rating based on features like title, author, genre, and description.

## Project Goals

- **Book Review Sentiment Analysis**: 
  - Use NLP techniques to analyze book reviews and classify them as positive or negative.
  - Experiment with traditional machine learning models and transformer models like BERT for improved accuracy.

- **Personalized Book Recommendation System**: 
  - Recommend books to users based on their past reading history using collaborative and content-based filtering methods.
  - Build a simple recommendation engine and extend it with deep learning approaches.

- **Predict a Book's Rating**: 
  - Predict a bookâ€™s rating by using features such as the title, author, genre, and description.
  - Implement regression models and explore the use of LSTM models for sequential text data.

## Dataset

The datasets used in these projects are from **Kaggle**:

- **Goodreads Reviews Dataset**: For sentiment analysis.
- **Goodreads Books Dataset**: For the recommendation system and rating prediction.

## Tech Stack

- **NLP and Sentiment Analysis**: 
  - NLTK for text preprocessing
  - Scikit-learn for sentiment classification models
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional for deep learning models like BERT)

- **Recommendation System**:
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Scikit-learn for traditional models
  - Surprise library for collaborative filtering
  - TensorFlow for deep learning models

- **Rating Prediction**:
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Scikit-learn for regression models
  - LSTM (TensorFlow/Keras) for sequence-based prediction models
